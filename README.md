# Neural-Network-Cars

This project demonstrates a car simulation using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to evolve neural networks that control the behavior of autonomous cars. The goal is for the cars to navigate through a track without colliding with the borders.

## How To Use

1. Launch the program.
2. Click and drag to draw the road on the screen.
3. Press the spacebar to start the simulation.
4. Cars will appear at the starting line (red line) and navigate the road.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python
